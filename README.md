## About The Project
Our group decided to work on a social calendar application with the aim of helping users to improve on collaboration with each other,
and inculcate a friendly, inclusive environment by having a common platform for them to view and share their calendars and events. 
This is in addition to serving as a personal scheduler just like a standard calendar application.

## Uniqueness
We derived that Calendars currently available in the market have the potential in spreading key dates and events publicly. 
However, the lack of social functions limits companies from sharing dates and events publicly across the internet. 
We see the potential in using this sharing function for friends to share and create interest groups based on their hobbies, 
by having various personal and public calendars, users can share events and milestones publicly.
Our application will mainly be used as a collaborative tool for better project management and community interaction for users to find common shared calendars and events. 
With these factors in mind, we hope to encourage a more socially active, organised and balanced lifestyle to our users.
